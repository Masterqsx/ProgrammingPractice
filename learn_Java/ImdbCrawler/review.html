<p><b>*** This review may contain spoilers ***</b></p>
<b>*** This review may contain spoilers ***</b><b>*** This review may contain spoilers ***</b>This movie was a box office success and I do not understand why.<br><br>You know what to expect from the Marvel franchise but this was a poorly written script even by their standards. I absolutely hate the overly clich√©d dialogue which has become tiresome. No real though went into the plot which is simplistic and fanciful. The special effects are good but it's loosely held together by a plot that doesn't make sense. For example I just found the whole idea that Deadpool believed he was going to persuade the person who tortured him and destroyed his life to help him completely ridiculous. That basically was the plot.<br><br>I know I'm in the minority here and that's sad. There are far better films that flop. The directing, the acting and the screenplay is nowhere near worthy of the rating on here.<form method="get" action="/register/login">

<br>I saw the movie like 1 month after the release.<br><br>This means a couple of my friends 'hyped' me up for this also very awaited movie. When the movie started I was ready for some good dirty jokes and a funny story. But I can already tell you the storyline is pretty bad and cheap, Like the jokes. I don't say this because it's not my kind of humor (because it is), but because the jokes we're 'easy'.<br><br>I went to see it with my girlfriend persuading her she will like it. I disappointed her and the movie disappointed me. Instead of watching 'The Revenent' I made the bad choice of not wanting to wait until I can see Deadpool later. I regret it a bit.<br><br>I am not saying it was a total failure but I think they could have made it a lot funnier with a real story ( not the story about his girlfriend). The story of him seeking revenge is like watching an old superhero storyline with simple 'good moments' than 'bad moments' and finely 'good moments' again.<br><br>I can understand some people think this movie was a success, maybe I had just too high expectations.<form method="get" action="/register/login">

<br>It was good. I enjoyed it. But I can't help but feel disappointed. Sure, it's a lot raunchier than the usual Marvel adaptation films, more violent. But at the end of the day, it really just felt like yet again another Marvel film- not bad at all, but just fine. Aside from the wink-wink self- awareness (which is also trying too hard at times), it's really just following the same type of formula any "superhero" film follows. The longer the film goes on, the more predictable it gets and the duller it gets as well. I would say that I did like it, but a few hours after seeing it and I don't think it's anything memorable at all. For all of the talk about how "shocking!" it was and all of the publicity, it's really not all that shocking. At the end of the day, it's just like the typical Marvel fare, just too formulaic for its own good.<br><br>Sounds like I hated it but not at all. I do feel like it could have been something truly, truly unique but what can you do. Ryan Reynolds is definitely the best thing about it though. Could have easily been too much, but he hits the notes perfectly.<form method="get" action="/register/login">

<br>Deadpool (2016) is a movie that is 10 years in the making and it was worth the wait. Unlike other superhero movies of this nature, 'Deadpool' is unique in the way that it was able to hold its own despite having an enormous weight of expectation placed upon it. 'Deadpool' did not crumble under this pressure and I can honestly say that I can happily go through the rest of 2016 knowing that 'Deadpool' was a complete success in every sense of the word. Not only was use of breaking the fourth wall executed perfectly, it was done in just the right amount. The "rated-R" style of comedy and violence could not have worked better in any other movie and it is safe to say that Ryan Reynolds is as much Deadpool as he is himself. My only negative opinion on the movie is that it did not contain as many fight scenes or fight scenes of large scale that I would have liked, but in retrospect it did not harm the overall experience of the film.<br><br>Thanks For Reading!<form method="get" action="/register/login">

<br>Ever since the abomination that was X-Men: Origins - Wolverine, fans have been dying to see a true and honest adaptation of the super- vulgar, mega-violent Merc With a Mouth, AKA, Deadpool. And, thanks to a fortunate leak of test footage in July of 2014, the day finally came much to the delight of myself and fans around the world. Simply put, there couldn't have been a better, more faithful and more entertaining film put on screen; Deadpool is one of a kind.<br><br>There are many things that make Deadpool well, Deadpool, and each and every one of those things are alive and well in the film. Pervasive language? Check. Over-the-top, gory violence? Check. Breaking the fourth wall? Absolutely perfect costume? Excessive sexual content, and the greatest (if most mature) sense of humor in all of superhero history? Check, check, check and CHECK! The undeniable dedication of source material from the film's writers and director Tim Miller is felt heavily in the movie, and there's nothing that the comic book faithful wanted more. <br><br>Watching Deadpool and his alter ego Wade Wilson swear like no tomorrow, crack countless jokes pertaining to other superhero movies among other hilarious subjects, and plow through bad guys with studious amounts of gore is down right fun to watch, leaving me with a smile on my face the entire time the camera was rolling. The character of Deadpool himself is arguably the greatest adaptation of any superhero (or anti-hero if you see it that way) in cinema history, a testament to the unrelenting passion of the superhero genre fan base. Fox may have destroyed the Fantastic Four, but Deadpool could not have been brought to life in a more absolutely perfect way.<br><br>Now, the man behind the mask. Outside of maybe Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man and Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Ryan Reynolds has proved to be one of the greatest castings for a comic book hero, ever. Reynolds pushed for this film ever since his first portrayal of Deadpool in the aforementioned pile of garbage that was Origins - Wolverine, wanting more than anything to properly display the character, without a sewed- up mouth. The marketing campaign for the film alone cemented Reynolds into this role for as long as he'd like, with every ounce of Deadpool's character played spot on by the man who once played Green Lantern (which he jokes about in the film). He delivers his lines perfectly, acts like the total nut job that Deadpool is, makes you laugh out loud and also is able to pull at your heart's strings occasionally. Few actors can so closely resemble their comic book character, and Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson/Deadpool is one of those actors. <br><br>The plot was as good as it needed to be, diving into Deadpool's origins through flashbacks showing how Wade Wilson transformed into the wise- cracking mercenary while maintaining the action and humor that the movie is all about. Along with Reynolds, supporting actors Morena Baccarin (Vanessa) T.J. Miller (Weasel), Stefan Kapicic (Colossus) and antagonist Ed Skrein (Ajax) all provide great support to the film, whether it's Weasel's comedic relief (to an action-comedy) Vanessa's love interest, Colossus's wonderful action or the awesome villain that is Ajax. The cast is great and helps Reynolds along the way of dominating the screen.<br><br>Deadpool is easily the most raunchy, hilarious and mature rated character in Marvel's roster, a character few ever thought would receive the film he deserved. Not only did he get his movie, but it's an instant classic. The attention to detail in the characters source material, perfectly showcasing the extremities of Deadpool lead the way for Ryan Reynolds to own the role of Wade Wilson/Deadpool and wildly entertain from the opening credits (literally) to after the credits role (literally). Deadpool is a love letter to the fans, and what once was a strong cult following has turned into a global phenomenon. Deadpool reserves its right as one of the best comic book films of all- time. <br><br>10/10<form method="get" action="/register/login">

<br>The movie was almost everything I expected in a Deadpool script. I only gave it an 8 because it tended to slow down a bit during the many origin story flashbacks, something that is unfortunate but necessary. Don't get me wrong, I understand why we need the origin story but Deadpool is just one of those rare occurrences where having to go back to the origins is really lame. Back when Deadpool was first released we needed an origin, that origin was used to gradually intrigue the reader and get them familiar with a hero who was set far outside the realm of what we expected a hero/villain to be. The more time that passed the more outrageous Deadpool became and he eventually grew into the figure that we know and love today. Now it feels like we were all put on hold so the story can go backwards and allow everyone else, who thinks comic books are stupid, to catch up. Again necessary for box office profits but it makes the rest of us bored during those periods of time. I'm not trying to discourage anyone from seeing it though, it is a really fun movie, the rest of it made me laugh uncontrollably, plenty of action, jokes, and gore to satisfy even the most hardened Deadpool fan. Plus now that the origin is out of the way Deadpool 2 can focus on taking all of the good stuff from this movie, and jamming more of it in the second one.<form method="get" action="/register/login">

<br>Hey everyone it's Connor once again, I have officially seen Deadpool three times. In my honest opinion, Deadpool is one of my top 5 favorite marvel films of all-time!<br><br>Ryan Reynolds redeems his superhero status and then knocks it out of the park playing the merc with the mouth! His performance is both timeless and outrageously hilarious!<br><br>Morena Baccarin is great as Wade's love interest Vanessa, as she captures the kinky funny girlfriend scheme perfectly.<br><br>The film touches on all aspects that I wanted to see, Action, sadness, romance, redemption, and pure badassery!<br><br>The music in this film also is awesome, from Juice Newton, to Chicago, to WHAM! It gives the film a ironic, yet fitting feel.<br><br>The only aspect that I can pick out that the film lacks is the budget setbacks, these are EXTREMELY minor and you cannot tell, but I can see the little details, and the funny thing is, the film jabs that too.<br><br>Deadpool is unlike any comic book movie ever made, because it gives us a giant superhero middle finger stereotype movie but with its own fresh concept that is flourishing in the box office.<br><br>Overall I loved this movie! I give Deadpool a solid 9/10 Highly recommend this movie to anyone!....over the age of 13 at least...<form method="get" action="/register/login">

<b>*** This review may contain spoilers ***</b><b>*** This review may contain spoilers ***</b>I still cant believe how many people love this movie. It makes me feel left out that i cant love the movie like everyone else. Well lets go to the positive parts of the film, the beginning credit scene is very smart and one of the best i have ever seen, not using the real names of the actors and just using what they are playing as is very original and i didn't see it coming. some of the comedy is good like the scene where dead pool gets angry at colossus and tries to hurt him is very funny but unfortunately there are more non funny then funny. and now the negative. the love story is stupid and i did not care if dead pool would get his girl back. The villain was also really dumb and not memorable. and the worst part of the movie, most of the jokes were not funny like i wanted them to be. what a shame, what a shame.<form method="get" action="/register/login">

<br>It's great to see a film that sets out to do something and absolutely nails it. And...the makers (whoever they were) must have met a lot of studio opposition. (I wonder whether the studio learned from the Ant-Man experience and just let the writers/ director/ actors ride the wave).<br><br>Admittedly you have to have an inner 13-year-old boy to enjoy it but a surprising number of people do.<br><br>And underneath all the stylism, the action, the talking to the camera, the jokes, the flipping back and forth (all brilliantly done) is a great love story.<br><br>Folks, you can be loved if you're ugly, though it helps if you have humour, a motor mouth, the odd superpower or two, and genuinely love the gal.<form method="get" action="/register/login">

<br>This is my first review here, done because this film is great if you know what you're getting into.<br><br>A lot of people just don't get it. Deadpool isn't a superhero. He isn't a nice guy. He's not even a serious character. He's a parody. His entire persona and his comics (and other media) are all built around satire. Marvel has literally pushed the envelope with this character. He started off as a serious supervillain, but eventually became and anti-hero. The further they went with him, the crazier he got and the less his comics made sense. But, they're not supposed to make sense.<br><br>With that in mind, the movie is pretty much a live action version of the comics. Extreme violence, dark humor and even stupidity abound. That's how Deadpool is. He's literally a joke. Treat him as such and you'll be fine. The movie also breaks through the Fourth Wall, as do the comics and other things, such as the video game. This is all part of Deadpool. Cracks about the stars, Marvel, Fox and pretty much everything else that isn't supposed to be "known" by the characters abound. Deadpool talks directly to the audience. Again, this is how the comics are. There's not much of a plot here. You're shown Deadpool's origins, which are similar to the comics, only changed slightly. Otherwise, it's basically a revenge flick and something of a love story. The plot is very basic, but that's how the comics are. In fact, Deadpool often doesn't have a plot.<br><br>So, this movie is basically going to appeal to two types of people: fans of the comic and people who like satire with heavy elements of dark humor. It's also very violent and contains nudity and sex. If you're like "Oh look, it's a Marvel movie. I loved this and that from Marvel, Deadpool must be another one of those," you probably won't enjoy the film. Deadpool ain't like other Marvel comics.<br><br>Oh, and if you took your kids to see this and were appalled by the violence, language and sex, that's on you. The MPAA exists for a reason, and they gave this film an "R" rating for strong violence, language, nudity and sex. Take two seconds to do some research before taking your kids to see a film. My sister did, which is why my 12-year-old niece hasn't seen this film.<form method="get" action="/register/login">
